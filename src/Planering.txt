Planering


1. Make interface 'Vehicle'. It'll have contents that should Car/Motorbike have. 
Even if there will be other type of Vehicles, from this interface, people can add any type of vechicles as much as they want. 
The contents will be 'getFee' that has the specific fee depending on vichles. 
and PrintDetail to print out and show the fee as a result. 

2. Make TollCacluator which contains how to caculate the fee. 
It'll get the fee information from car/motorbike files, but it'll also show how to caculate the fee with specific time. 
Time will be sett with 4 numbers, but if it has 0 on the first place, it won't be need to be written. 
Using for-loop, if the time as input is in 800~900 or 1600~1700, it will show the maximum fee which is 18kr because it's during rushhour. 
Using 'if', get the information and fee if it's passed during rushhour and charge the fee. 
Also, if it's not in rushhour, it has to calculate the regular fee. Using 'if' again inside of that, 
charge the regular fee if it's not passed during rush hour. 

3. If its fee is more than 60, the fee won't be charged more, so set this up too after 'number 2's process. 
Return total fee.

4.After these, test will be need on TollCalculatortester file. Make arrayers as input with random times, random length to test it.
If it's car, use the car class, if it's motorbike, use the motorbike class. Then it will calculate the fee using TollCaculator, 
and print the result using 'PrintDetail'. User can get the all information. The fee for each vehicles, for Rush hour, mamxium fee, 
how many times it's passed the road. The total fee will be printed as the last.
